## Monolake

Introducing **Monolake**: a **Rust** proxy built on the **io-uring** based runtime [Monoio](https://github.com/bytedance/monoio). Leveraging the efficiency and power of **IO-uring**, Monolake harnesses the full potential of modern asynchronous I/O operations for high-speed networking. Written in **Rust**, Monolake ensures memory safety, eliminating common memory-related bugs and providing a secure networking solution. Utilize Monolake to develop powerful proxies and load balancers for your high-throughput applications.
