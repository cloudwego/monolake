# Monolake

Monolake is a Rust-based high performance Layer 4/7 proxy framework which is built on the [Monoio](https://github.com/bytedance/monoio) runtime.

## Quick Start

The following guide is trying to use monolake with the basic proxy features.

### Preparation

```bash
# install rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/cloudwego/monolake.git
cd monolake

# generate certs
sh -c "cd examples && ./gen_cert.sh"
```

### Build

```bash
# build dev binary
cargo build

# build release binary
cargo build --release

# build lto release binary
cargo build --profile=release-lto
```

### Run examples

```bash
# run example with debug version
cargo run --package monolake -- -c examples/config.toml

# enable debug logging level
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --package monolake -- -c examples/config.toml

# send https request
curl -vvv --cacert examples/certs/rootCA.crt --resolve "gateway.monolake.rs:8082:127.0.0.1"  https://gateway.monolake.rs:8082/
```

## Limitations

1. On Linux 5.6+, both uring and epoll are supported
2. On Linux 2.6+, only epoll is supported
3. On macOS, kqueue is used
4. Other platforms are currently not supported

## Call for help
